# datamining-hw2
This project is a part of Data mining techniques Homework 2  

In any IDE (IntelliJ in my case), set the program arguments (file name itemset frequency) for the main method. 
For instance, **transactions.txt 10**
Now, we cand directly run the program by chaning the frequency everytime.
